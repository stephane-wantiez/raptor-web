==========

HTML5 game called "1945: Mission Raptor", inspired from "Raptor: Call of the Shadows" and the "1945" tutorial for GameMaker.

Created for the Web game programming course of SupInfoGame SIG4GP.


TODO:
- Add more feedbacks for enemy and player damages
- Get sprites of original game (w/ Camoto tool? DotEmu?) - or use sprites of 1942 (no more Raptor...)
- Add FlyingActor class with shadow generation (Player will also have that class as prototype)
- Add Building class for buildings (with Actor as prototype)
- Adapt game for touch screen (touch instead of mouse click? permanent shoot?)
